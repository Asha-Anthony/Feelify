## Step 1: Cloning the Repository

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory where you want to store the project.
3. Clone the repository using the following command:

`git clone <repository_url>`

## Step 2: Installing Dependencies

1. Open your terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the root folder of the cloned project using the `cd` command.
3. Once you are in the root folder, run the following commands to install the required dependencies for the React app:


`npm install`
`pip install requirements.txt`

This will install all the necessary libraries and packages specified in the package.json file.

## Step 3: Running the Python Server

1. Open a new terminal or command prompt window.
2. Navigate to the directory where the Python server code is located. It is inside the `backend` folder.
3. Run the following command to start the Python server:
`python server.py`
Make sure that the server is up and running without any errors.

## Step 4: Starting the React App

1. Go back to the terminal or command prompt window where you installed the npm packages (from Step 2).
2. In the same terminal window, run the following command to start the React app:

`npm start`
This will start the development server for the React app.


## Step 5: Accessing the Application

1. After running the `npm start` command, a new browser window or tab should automatically open, displaying the React app.
2. If the browser doesn't open automatically, you can manually open your preferred web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3000`.

## Step 6: Interacting with the Application

1. You should now see the application running in your browser.
2. Explore the various features and functionalities of the application. The app will analyze your emotion and generate music for you which might be suitable for your current mood.

If you encounter any issues during the setup process, make sure to check for any error messages in the terminal or command prompt windows for troubleshooting.
